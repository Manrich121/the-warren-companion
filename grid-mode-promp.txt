Implement "Adds a toggle to switch search results to grid or list view, and stores this preference in local storage." use @grid-poc.png, @search-results-row-layout.png, @search-results-table.html and   @the-warren-site-styles.css as references. Keep it simple. The icons are in @images. Place the toggle next to the cloned pagination controls and use the primary color to indicate which mode is active.
